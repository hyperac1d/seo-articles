        <img class="responsive-img" src="img/SEO-Search-Engine-Optimisation.jpg" alt="SEO" height="300px" width="570px"><hr>
        <p class="flow-text">There are many people around the world who are just starting to blog and many more that have run their own blog site for a while, that really don't know the purpose of SEO is and how to implement it!</p>

        <p class="sub-title"><b>Search Engine Optimization</b></p>
        <p>Before we go through all the guidelines on how to read search engine optimization, let's now define first what seo is. SEO is an acronym name that means Search Engine Optimization. What's really the purpose of it in our blog? So.. SEO is a process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site will appear high in a search engine result page (SERP).</p>

        <p class="sub-title"><b>Guidelines on how to read a search engine result page</b></p>
        <b>1. Understanding an individual search result</b>
        <p>Result block on a search  result page that consist of three major elements</p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="img/search-result.png" alt="Search Result Page Sample" height="300px" width="570px"> 
        <p><i>Figure:</i> As we notice that when we use our mouse to point at a particular search result, called result block. A single result block consist primarily of the title, URL, and snippet(some contents of the blog).</p>

        <p><b>Title:</b> The blue text color that has underline gives you the topic of the page.</p>
        <p><b>Web address/URL:</b> The second line or the green text tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of information.</p>
        <p><b>Snippet:</b>The last two lines, the black text, show you some content of the places where your search terms appear on the page. Some of the snippets contains ellipses that means that the text is taken out and replaced by the ellipses(...).</p>

        <b>2. Using an entire results page</b>
        <p>Is is not only helpful to know how to understand a single result page, but you can learn a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire page full of results.</p>
        <img class="responsive-img" src="img/whole-search.png" alt="Whole Search Result Page" height="300px" width="570px"> 
        <p><i>Figure:</i>As you look at the results, you may notice many different blogs containing similar result to the phrase being searched. Some results talks about the types of dogs, List of Dogs from A-Z, List of all dog breeds by type, traits, etc..</p>
        <p>As you see, the first result mentions "List of Dog Profiles". First of all we need to understand how a breed of dog is defined ... or whom.</p>
        <p>I hope that this lesson demonstrated that the search results page is an interesting information set and of itself. By looking through the different results, you can now extract a sense for where your question can be most possibly be answered.</p>

        <p class="sub-title"><b>How SEO affects business?</b></p>
        <p>Lots of people who are new to blogging are really asking how SEO affects business.</p>
        <p>Then let's start:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It affects business by making the content found in your website more relevant to what potential customers want.</li><br>
          <li>By putting your business in the various search engines, SEO makes it easier for people to found your site regarding your business. It is also a good way of making your website more attractive, thus increasing readability and the amount of people spend on the page, which is also valuable.</li><br>
          <li>Last but not the least, we don't actually know the exact formula and there's an entire industry of people trying their very best to figure it out and then remarket the specific tactics and layout suggested by their experimental data/gueses. These people are called Search Engine Optimizer specialist and while some of them are marketing profesisonals.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p class="sub-title"><b>Important SEO expectations</b></p>
        <p>In this content, I will be explaining some of the most important SEO expectations</p>
        <p><b class="sub-topic">1. Speed of Ranking Increases</b></p>
        <p>When SEO is done right, ranking will increase. Sounds confusing?.. The speed of the increase is something that the SEO specialist only has so much control over. There are many factors that it is difficult to make good judgements on how long it will take for a keyword to a hit a certain page or position.</p><br>
        <p><b class="sub-topic">2. Number of keywords targeted</b></p>
        <p>Clients want to rank for everything, but most client aren't willing to pay to rank for everything at once even when they recognize that their SEO budget leaves them shy of being able to tackle some highly competetive terms, they'll inevitably try to get them onto the keyword reasearch list.</p> 
        <p><b>3. Number of Leads</b></p>
        <p>From and SEO's <strong>point of view,</strong>the basis objective of a campaign is to increase relevant keyword rankings, which should result in site traffic, which should in enough profit to justify the campaign expense.</p>

        <p class="sub-title"><b>SEO in Marketing</b></p>
        <p>Web <i>optimization</i> is an advertising discipline concentrated on developing perceivability in natural (non-paid) web search tool comes about. Web optimization envelops both the specialized and inventive components required to enhance rankings, drive movement, and increment mindfulness in web indexes.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
        <p><a href="/wiki/Webmaster" title="Webmaster">Webmasters</a> and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early <a href="/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">Web</a>. Initially, all webmasters needed only to submit the address of a page, or <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" class="mw-redirect" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</a>, to the various engines which would send a "<a href="/wiki/Web_crawler" title="Web crawler">spider</a>" to "crawl" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be <a href="/wiki/Index_(search_engine)" class="mw-redirect" title="Index (search engine)">indexed</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an <a href="/wiki/Search_engine_indexing" title="Search engine indexing">indexer</a>, extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.</p>
        <p>Site owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> creating an opportunity for both <a href="/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)" title="White hat (computer security)">white hat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_hat_hacking" class="mw-redirect" title="Black hat hacking">black hat</a> SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst <a href="/wiki/Danny_Sullivan_(technologist)" title="Danny Sullivan (technologist)">Danny Sullivan</a>, the phrase "search engine optimization" probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> On May 2, 2007,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Jason Gambert attempted to trademark the term SEO by convincing the Trademark Office in Arizona<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> that SEO is a "process" involving manipulation of keywords and not a "marketing service."</p>
        <p>Early versions of search <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword <a href="/wiki/Meta_tag" class="mw-redirect" title="Meta tag">meta tag</a> or index files in engines like <a href="/wiki/Aliweb" title="Aliweb">ALIWEB</a>. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using meta data to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The material near this tag is possibly inaccurate or nonfactual. (October 2012)">dubious</span></a> <span class="metadata">– <a href="/wiki/Talk:Search_engine_optimization#Dubious" title="Talk:Search engine optimization">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup> Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
        <p>By 1997, search engine designers recognized that <a href="/wiki/Webmaster" title="Webmaster">webmasters</a> were making efforts to rank well in their search engine, and that some webmasters were even <a href="/wiki/Spamdexing" title="Spamdexing">manipulating their rankings</a> in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as <a href="/wiki/Altavista" class="mw-redirect" title="Altavista">Altavista</a> and <a href="/wiki/Infoseek" title="Infoseek">Infoseek</a>, adjusted their algorithms in an effort to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.<sup id="cite_ref-infoseeknyt_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-infoseeknyt-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
        <p>By relying so much on factors such as <a href="/wiki/Keyword_density" title="Keyword density">keyword density</a> which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their <a href="/wiki/Search_engine_results_page" title="Search engine results page">results pages</a> showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.<sup id="cite_ref-Forbes_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Forbes-13">[13]</a></sup> Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate.</p>
        <p>In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb, Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimization and related topics.<sup id="cite_ref-airweb_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-airweb-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Companies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the <i><a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" class="mw-redirect" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported on a company, <a href="/wiki/Traffic_Power" title="Traffic Power">Traffic Power</a>, which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Wired_(magazine)" title="Wired (magazine)">Wired</a></i> magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban.<sup id="cite_ref-wired09082005_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wired09082005-16">[16]</a></sup> Google's <a href="/wiki/Matt_Cutts" title="Matt Cutts">Matt Cutts</a> later confirmed that Google did in fact ban Traffic Power and some of its clients.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry, and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, chats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with site optimization.<sup id="cite_ref-g-wmguide_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-g-wmguide-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ms-wmguide_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ms-wmguide-19">[19]</a></sup> Google has a <a href="/wiki/Sitemaps" title="Sitemaps">Sitemaps</a> program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.<sup id="cite_ref-googlesitemaps_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-googlesitemaps-20">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Bing_Webmaster_Center" class="mw-redirect" title="Bing Webmaster Center">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the crawl rate, and track the web pages index status.</p>

Two major directories, the Yahoo Directory and <a href="/wiki/DMOZ" title="DMOZ">DMOZ</a>, both require manual submission and human editorial review.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Google offers <a href="/wiki/Google_Webmaster_Tools" class="mw-redirect" title="Google Webmaster Tools">Google Search Console</a>, for which an XML <a href="/wiki/Sitemap" class="mw-redirect" title="Sitemap">Sitemap</a> feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> in addition to their URL submission console.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed crawling for a <a href="/wiki/Pay_per_click" class="mw-redirect" title="Pay per click">cost per click</a>;<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> this was discontinued in 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Search engines use complex mathematical algorithms to guess which websites a user seeks. In this diagram, if each bubble represents a website, programs sometimes called <i>spiders</i> examine which sites link to which other sites, with arrows representing these links. Websites getting more inbound links, or stronger links, are presumed to be more important and what the user is searching for. In this example, since website B is the recipient of numerous inbound links, it ranks more highly in a web search. And the links "carry through", such that website C, even though it only has one inbound link, has an inbound link from a highly popular site (B) while site E does not. Note: Percentages are rounded.</p>

Not every page is indexed by the search engines.

    <p>To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard <a href="/wiki/Robots.txt" class="mw-redirect" title="Robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a <a href="/wiki/Meta_tag" class="mw-redirect" title="Meta tag">meta tag</a> specific to robots. When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the <a href="/wiki/Root_directory" title="Root directory">root directory</a> is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup></p>
